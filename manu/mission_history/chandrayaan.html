                Chandrayaan is the name of India's lunar exploration program conducted by the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO). The term "Chandrayaan" means "moon vehicle" in Sanskrit. The program aims to
                explore the Moon's surface, study its composition, and enhance scientific understanding of Earth's
                celestial neighbor.

                <strong>There have been multiple missions under the Chandrayaan program:</strong>

              <strong>Chandrayaan-1:</strong><br>
              <p>
                Launched on October 22, 2008, Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe.
                The spacecraft carried various scientific instruments, including a Moon Impact Probe (MIP) that
                crash-landed on the lunar surface, and an instrument designed to detect water molecules on the Moon.
                Chandrayaan-1 confirmed the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface, particularly in the polar
                regions.
                The mission was successful until August 2009 when ISRO lost contact with the spacecraft. However, it
                significantly contributed to lunar exploration and discovery.

            <li><strong>Chandrayaan-2:</strong><br>
              <p>
                Launched on July 22, 2019, Chandrayaan-2 was a more extensive mission comprising an orbiter, a lander
                named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan.
                The mission aimed to study the lunar surface, analyze the distribution of elements and minerals, and
                search for water ice in the south polar region.
                The Vikram lander was supposed to perform a soft landing near the lunar south pole, but unfortunately,
                contact with the lander was lost during the descent phase, resulting in a failed landing.
                However, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter remains operational and continues to orbit the Moon, conducting
                scientific observations and studies.
                Chandrayaan-2, despite the setback with the lander, has contributed significantly to India's space
                exploration capabilities and continues to provide valuable data from its orbiter.<br><br>

              <strong>Chandrayaan-3:</strong>
              <p>
                Chandrayaan-3 is intended as a continuation of India's lunar exploration program, aiming to further
                study and explore the Moon's surface.
                The primary objective is to achieve a successful soft landing on the lunar surface, specifically
                targeting the south pole region of the Moon.
                Development work and preparations for Chandrayaan-3 were ongoing, including design modifications and
                improvements based on lessons learned from Chandrayaan-2.
                ISRO had been working on rectifying the issues that led to the failure of the Vikram lander during
                Chandrayaan-2's landing attempt.
