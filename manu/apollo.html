            <p>The Apollo Program was a monumental effort by NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) to
                land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back to Earth. It was a key part of the United States' space
                exploration efforts during the 1960s and early 1970s. The program had several missions, with Apollo 11 being
                the most famous for achieving the first manned lunar landing. Here are some key details about the Apollo
                Program:
            </p>
            <p >
                <strong>Goals:</strong><br>
    
                The primary goal of the Apollo Program, set by President John F. Kennedy in a speech to Congress on May 25,
                1961, was to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth before the end of the decade. <br><br>
                <strong>Timeline:</strong><br>
    
                The program began in earnest with the launch of Apollo 7, the first manned mission, on October 11, 1968.
                Apollo 11, the historic mission that achieved the first human landing on the Moon, took place on July 20,
                1969.
                The Apollo Program continued with a total of 17 missions, with the last manned mission being Apollo 17 in
                December 1972.<br><br>
                <strong>Apollo Missions:</strong><br>
    
                Apollo missions included both crewed and uncrewed flights, each serving a specific purpose in the overall
                goal of lunar exploration.
                Notable missions include Apollo 8, the first crewed mission to orbit the Moon, and Apollo 13, which
                encountered a critical situation but managed to return safely to Earth. <br><br>
                <strong>Apollo 11 (July 20, 1969):</strong><br>
    
                The crew of Apollo 11 consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar
                Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin.
                Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first and second humans to set foot on the lunar surface, while
                Michael Collins orbited the Moon in the command module.
                Armstrong's famous words as he stepped onto the Moon's surface were, "That's one small step for [a] man, one
                giant leap for mankind." <br><br>
                <strong>Technology:</strong><br>
    
                The Saturn V rocket, one of the most powerful rockets ever built, was used to launch the Apollo missions
                into space.
                The Apollo spacecraft consisted of the command module, where the crew lived and worked, the service module,
                providing support functions, and the lunar module, designed to land on and take off from the Moon. <br><br>
                <strong>Legacy:</strong><br>
    
                The Apollo Program is considered one of the greatest achievements in the history of human space exploration.
                It provided valuable scientific data about the Moon and space travel and contributed to advancements in
                technology and engineering.
                The program's success was a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the thousands of people involved in
                the effort. <br><br>
