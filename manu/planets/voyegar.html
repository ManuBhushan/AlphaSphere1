            <p>The Voyager Program consists of two spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, launched by NASA in 1977 to explore the outer planets of our solar system and beyond. These spacecraft have provided invaluable data and discoveries, revolutionizing our understanding of the outer planets and venturing into interstellar space. Here are some key details about the Voyager Program:
            </p>
            <p >
                <strong>Launch and Mission Objectives:</strong><br>
    
                Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977, followed by Voyager 2 on August 20, 1977.
The primary mission objectives were to study the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and their moons, rings, magnetic fields, and atmospheres. <br><br>
                <strong>Grand Tour and Planetary Alignment:</strong><br>
    
                The Voyager mission took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets that occurs once every 175 years, allowing both spacecraft to visit all four gas giants in a single mission.<br><br>
                <strong>Interstellar Mission:</strong><br>
    
                After completing their primary mission objectives, both Voyager spacecraft continued their journey into the heliosheath, the outermost layer of the Sun's heliosphere, and eventually entered interstellar space.
Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in 2012, becoming the first human-made object to do so.
Voyager 2 followed and also entered interstellar space in 2018, providing valuable data on the boundaries of our solar system.
 <br><br>
                <strong>Golden Records:</strong><br>
    
                Both Voyager spacecraft carry a Golden Record, a phonograph record containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. The record is intended as a message to any extraterrestrial intelligence that might encounter the spacecraft. <br><br>
                <strong>Current Status:</strong><br>
    
                Both Voyager spacecraft are operational and continue to communicate with Earth using radio signals. However, as they venture farther from the Sun, their power supply diminishes, and eventually, they will cease transmitting data.
The Voyager probes are expected to continue their journey into interstellar space, carrying the Golden Record and representing humanity's farthest reach into the cosmos. <br><br>
                
            <h2>
                <center>The Voyager Program has been a monumental success, providing a wealth of information about the outer planets and their environments, and serving as ambassadors of human civilization to the unknown depths of space. </center>
