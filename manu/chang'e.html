            <p>The Chang'e program is China's lunar exploration initiative led by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). Named after the Chinese Moon goddess Chang'e, this program consists of several missions aimed at exploring the Moon, conducting scientific research, and developing capabilities for future lunar exploration. Here are the key missions and details of the Chang'e program:</p>
            <p >
                <strong>Chang'e-1:</strong><br>
    
                Launched in October 2007, Chang'e-1 was China's first lunar probe.
It conducted various scientific experiments, including lunar mapping, studying the Moon's surface, and analyzing its geological composition.
The mission orbited the Moon and provided high-resolution images of the lunar surface.<br><br>
                <strong>Chang'e-2:</strong><br>
    
                Launched in October 2010, Chang'e-2 was a follow-up to the Chang'e-1 mission.
Its primary objectives included further lunar mapping and collecting more detailed data of the Moon's surface.
After completing its lunar mission, Chang'e-2 was redirected to explore the asteroid Toutatis in 2012, marking the first Chinese spacecraft to fly by an asteroid.<br><br>
                <strong>Chang'e-3:</strong><br>
    
                Launched in December 2013, Chang'e-3 was China's first mission to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface.
It carried a rover named Yutu (or Jade Rabbit), which successfully landed on the Moon and conducted scientific experiments, analyzing lunar soil and geological features.
Chang'e-3 operated for several years, exceeding its expected mission duration.
 <br><br>
                <strong>Chang'e-4:</strong><br>
    
                Launched in December 2018, Chang'e-4 was a groundbreaking mission, being the first to successfully land on the far side of the Moon.
The mission included a lander and a rover named Yutu-2, which continues to explore and study the lunar surface, conducting experiments and gathering data.
Chang'e-4 has made significant contributions to our understanding of the far side of the Moon, including its geology and radiation environment. <br><br>
                <strong>Chang'e-5:</strong><br>
    
                Launched in November 2020, Chang'e-5 was a complex mission designed to collect lunar samples and return them to Earth.
It successfully collected samples from the Moon's surface and completed a return-to-Earth mission, marking the first lunar sample return mission since the 1970s. <br><br>
